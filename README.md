# Basic-loops-and-operators-in-CPP

🎯Aim: To study and implement basic loops in C++.

⚙️Tools: C++ IDE/ visual studio code.

💡Theory: 
Operators can be of different types-
1. Arithmetic Operators- These help carry out different mathematical operations like adding numbers, subtraction , multiplication, division ,etc without the need of math libraries.
2. Logical Operators - These perform logical functions like AND(&&),OR(||),NOT(!).
3. Relational Operators- These operators carry out comparision between two different quantities. Like less than, greater than, equal to , etc.
4. Bitwise Operators

Loops: Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. They help avoid writing repetitive code.
🔹 1. for Loop- Used when the number of iterations is known.
Initialization (int i = 0)
Condition (i < 5)
Update (i++)


✅Conclusion : With the help of these codes we laernt to implement basic if-else and if-elseif-else loops, using the LOGICAL OPERATOR 'AND (&&)'  and RELATIONAL OPERATOR '>', '<', '='.
